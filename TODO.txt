TODO:

LSTM: 
- Add velocities
- normalization
	- start and end on x-axis
	*adding velocities might do the same thing
- regularization
	- did batchnorm  on enc, dec, encdec
		- 6ep bs4
		-trained on all, but should train on agents only
			- do 1 ep bs 4
	- batchnorm on only agents
	- l1,l2 if we can figure that out
	- check if dropout would even work in this situation
- optimizer
	- sgd, and sgd variants
	- mess with hyperparameters

Transformer model:
TODO everything
