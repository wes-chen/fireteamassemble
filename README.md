This repo is a for a Kaggle Competition. The competition aims to predict 3 seconds of trajectory given 2 seconds. The final result of our model is 4th place.

You can read about the Process, Results, and Analysis in Final_Report.pdf

Exploratory Data Analysis is in the notebook: Argoverse_EDA.ipynb

The final model can be found in the notebook: Simple_Encoder_Decoder_LSTM+velocity.ipynb
